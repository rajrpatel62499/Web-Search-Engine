A key part of our commitment to responsibility is enforcing these guidelines and removing policy-violating content. We've put together a few key data points to show you how we're progressing with our responsibility efforts – if you'd like to know more, you can find details on our dedicated Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. Removal reason Detection source Removal by views Videos removed, by removal reason YouTube relies on teams around the world to review flagged videos and remove content that violates Community Guidelines; restrict videos (e.g. age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences); or leave the content live when it doesn't violate our guidelines. This exhibit shows the volume of videos removed by YouTube by the reason why a video was removed. These removal reasons correspond to YouTube's Community Guidelines. Reviewers evaluate flagged videos against all of our Community Guidelines and policies, regardless of why the video was originally flagged. 29.9% 1.87M - Child safety 22.4% 1.40M - Nudity or sexual 16.8% 1.05M - Violent or graphic 14.1% 884K - Spam, misleading and scams 4.8% 299K - Harmful or dangerous 3.7% 233K - Harassment and cyberbullying 1.4% 87K - Hateful or abusive 6.9% 431K - Promotion of violence and violent extremism 0.1% 7K - Other April 2021–June 2021 Videos removed, by first source of detection This chart shows the volume of videos removed by YouTube, by source of first detection (automated flagging or human detection). Flags from human detection can come from a user or a member of YouTube's Trusted Flagger programme. Trusted Flagger programme members include individuals, NGOs and government agencies that are particularly effective at notifying YouTube of content that violates our Community Guidelines. April 2021–June 2021 Videos removed, by views YouTube strives to prevent content that breaks our rules from being widely viewed – or viewed at all – before it's removed. Automated flagging enables us to act more quickly and accurately to enforce our policies. This chart shows the percentage of video removals that occurred before they received any views versus those that occurred after receiving some views. 37.9% 0 views 36.7% 1–10 views 25.4% 10+ views April 2021–June 2021 Related articles Community Guidelines Read more Managing harmful content Read more Standing up to hate Read more Connect About YouTube About Blog How YouTube Works Jobs Press YouTube Culture & Trends Products YouTube Go YouTube Kids YouTube Music YouTube Originals YouTube Premium YouTube Select YouTube Studio YouTube TV For Business Developers YouTube Advertising For Creators Creating for YouTube Kids Creator Academy Creator Research Creator Services Directory YouTube Artists YouTube Creators YouTube NextUp YouTube VR Our Commitments Creators for Change CSAI Match Social impact About YouTube Products For Business For Creators Our Commitments About Blog How YouTube Works Jobs Press YouTube Culture & Trends YouTube Go YouTube Kids YouTube Music YouTube Originals YouTube Premium YouTube Select YouTube Studio YouTube TV Developers YouTube Advertising Creating for YouTube Kids Creator Academy Creator Research Creator Services Directory YouTube Artists YouTube Creators YouTube NextUp YouTube VR Creators for Change CSAI Match Social impact Policies & safety Copyright Brand guidelines Privacy Terms Help English Deutsch (Österreich) English (Australia) Nederlands (België) ??????????
