Deep dives Spotlights Records Deep dives Separated by up to thousands of miles but intimately connected by screens that provide windows into each other's worlds, creators have invited viewers to take part in their everyday activities through 'with me' videos for almost a decade. Despite the uncertainty that came with COVID-19, millions of individuals took to YouTube, reminding us all that we can find our way through, together. We started the #WithMe campaign to encourage folks to do things at home, together. From learning new skills to finding new ways of teaching and learning, together we've found new ways to share the uniquely creative ways we are getting through this time – not just as consumers of video, but as human beings trying to find a way together. See how we bring the data behind this trend to life through visualisations and context. Explore in depth Spotlights Spotlights are an ongoing exploration of the various communities that exist on YouTube. We highlight stories that join the dots between data points and larger global trends. Creator on the Rise is a global programme that highlights emerging channels and exposes us to communities and content formats before they hit the mainstream. In 2020, we launched the YouTube Culture & Trends report: an interactive video summary of the present moment in digital entertainment, content and culture. Examining everything from the emergence of creator culture to new forms of audience behaviour, the report offers insight into what's behind the most interesting trends in the past year. And in doing so, it aims to provide some perspective on how to think about this space in the future.
