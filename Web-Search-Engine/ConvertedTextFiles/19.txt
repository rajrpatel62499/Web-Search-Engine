We understand at YouTube and across Google that when you use our services, you're trusting us with your information. This is a big responsibility and we work hard to protect your information and put you in control. For example, Google's Privacy Policy is designed to give you transparency over what information we collect, why we collect it and how you can manage your information. Your data in YouTube is a powerful, easy-to-use tool designed to give you control over the privacy settings that are right for you, and provides information on the data that we collect and use across our services. Protecting viewer data Privacy guidelines Does YouTube sell viewer data? We do not sell your personal information to anyone. We use the information that we collect to customise our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalising search results and serving relevant ads for you. While these ads help fund our services and make them free for everyone, your personal information is not for sale. YouTube has long provided powerful, meaningful privacy controls, such as Your data in YouTube, which makes it easier for you to understand and control what data is saved and how it is used on YouTube and across Google. Resources Understanding the basics of privacy on YouTube apps YouTube privacy guidelines aim to protect users' privacy and sense of safety while balancing public interest and newsworthiness. We're serious about protecting our users by addressing potential privacy concerns, and these guidelines apply to all users across the world. In other words, while a video may not violate your country's privacy laws, it may still violate YouTube's privacy guidelines.
