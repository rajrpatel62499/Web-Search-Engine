We also provide ways for you to tell us when we're recommending something that you aren't interested in. For example, buttons on the homepage and in the 'Up next' section allow you to filter and choose recommendations by specific topics. You can also click on 'not interested' to signal to YouTube that a video or channel is not what you wanted to see at that time. Resources Manage your recommendations Manage your YouTube watch and search history Learn more about recommendations on YouTube Reducing the spread of borderline content and harmful misinformation Our commitment to openness means that we may have content available on the platform that comes close to violating our policies but does not quite cross the line. We think that it's important to protect freedom of expression, but we set a high bar for what videos we display prominently in our recommendations on the YouTube homepage or through the 'Up next' panel. We are constantly working to improve our systems to reduce recommendations on borderline content and videos that could misinform users in a harmful way, particularly in areas that rely on veracity – such as news, medicine, historical events or science.
