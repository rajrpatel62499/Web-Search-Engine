We built YouTube Kids to create a safer environment for children to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving you controls in the app that enable you to customise your children's experience. You can create individual profiles for each child, decide what content to make available, block videos or channels that you don't want your children to see, set a timer to limit screen time, see recent videos that your children have been watching and much more. *YouTube Kids is not available in Quebec at this time. Parental controls: Control and restrict what children can watch on YouTube Kids Resources Learn more about YouTube's options for families YouTube Kids YouTube Kids is a dedicated app built from the ground up with children in mind. It was launched in 2015 to give children a safer, more contained viewing environment. YouTube Kids has content settings that offer three options (Pre-school, Younger and Older) and parental controls such as a timer to control screen time and the ability to block videos or channels. Content in YouTube Kids is diverse but a much smaller selection of the content on YouTube, selected using a combination of human review, curated playlists from experts and algorithmic filtering. Parental controls: Control and restrict what children can watch on YouTube Kids Resources Learn more about YouTube Kids and controls for parents Supervised experience on YouTube beta In 2021 we launched a new choice for parents who've decided that their tweens or teens are ready to explore YouTube with a supervised account. Parents link their child's Google Account to their own before granting them access to YouTube and then choose from content settings that generally align with content ratings for pre-teens and older. The experience looks much like YouTube's flagship app and website, but with adjustments to the content that a child can find and watch, features that they can use, default account settings and ad protections. The experience also works with Family Link, offering additional parental controls to help guide children as they learn, play and explore online.
