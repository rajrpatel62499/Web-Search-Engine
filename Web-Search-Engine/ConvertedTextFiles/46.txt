That's why we have policies to help build a safer community. Community Guidelines Our Community Guidelines define what we allow and don't allow on YouTube. They exist so that we can protect the community from things such as harmful content, harassment and spam. They apply to everyone, and to all types of content on YouTube – such as videos, comments, links and thumbnails. Learn More Copyright We have developed a set of resources to help creators understand copyright, protect their own copyrighted content and avoid violating copyright laws. Learn More Monetisation policies The YouTube Partner Programme empowers creators to make money through their channels. To become a YouTube Partner, creators must follow our monetisation policies. These policies are intended to reward creators who contribute positively to the community with original content. Eligible creators who want to monetise their content by running advertisements need to follow our advertiser-friendly content guidelines in addition to our broader monetisation policies.
